knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Load Data

The dataset is from kaggle:https://www.kaggle.com/mustafaali96/weight-height

```{r}
h_w <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irene908/DATA605/main/h_w.csv")
head(h_w)
```

## Plot

```{r}
plot(h_w)
```

## Linear Model

```{r}
L <- lm(Weight ~ Height, h_w)
summary(L)
```

*intercept* is -350.73719 and *slope* is 7.71729 

So the One-Factor Regression Model is:

$Weight = -350.73719 + 7.71729 * Height$

## Plot with linear model

```{r}
plot(h_w,col="maroon")
abline(L)
```

## Residual Plot

```{r}
plot(fitted(L), resid(L))
```

The above plot shows that around zero the residuals are uniformly distributed.

## Q-Q Plot

The below Q-Q plot also show that the residuals are normally distributed.

```{r}
qqnorm(resid(L))
qqline(resid(L),col="blue")
```
