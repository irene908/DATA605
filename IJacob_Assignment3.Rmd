# Problem set 1

## 1.

What is the rank of the matrix A?

```{r}
A <- matrix(c(1,2,3,4,-1,0,1,3,0,1,-2,1,5,4,-2,-3), 4, 4, byrow=TRUE)
A
```

The rank is: 

```{r}
Rank(A)
```

## 2. 

Given an mxn matrix where m > n, what can be the maximum rank? The minimum rank, assuming that the matrix is non-zero?

The maximum rank is:
$Rank \leq n$

The minimum rank is 1 as the matrix is non-zero.

## 3.

What is the rank of matrix B?

```{r}
B <- matrix(c(1,2,1,3,6,3,2,4,2),3, 3, byrow=TRUE)
B
```

```{r}
Rank(B)
```

# Problem set 2

Compute the eigen values and eigen vectors of the matrix A. You’ll need to show your work.  You’ll need to write out the characteristic polynomial and show your solution.

```{r}
A <- matrix(c(1,2,3,0,4,5,0,0,6),3, 3, byrow=TRUE)
A
```

The characteristic polynomial is: 

```{r}
charpoly(A)
```

The eigen values and eigen vectrs are:

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("C:\\eigen.jpg")
eigen(A)
```
