## 1. 

*Use integration by substitution to solve the integral below.*

$\int4e^{-7x}dx$

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("C://13.1.jpeg")
```

## 2. 

*Biologists are treating a pond contaminated with bacteria.  The level of contamination is changing at a rate of* $\:\frac{\text{d}N}{\text{d}t}= -(\frac{3150}{t^{-4}})-220$ *bacteria per cubic centimeter per day, where t is the number of days since treatment began.  Find a function N(t) to estimate the level of contamination if the level after 1 day was 6530 bacteria per cubic centimeter.*

## 3.

*Find the total area of the red rectangles in the figure below, where the equation of the line is* $f(x)=2x-9$

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("C://13.3a.jpeg")
```

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("C://13.3.jpeg")
```

```{r}
a <- function(x) {2*x -9}
integrate(a, 4.5, 8.5)
```


## 4.

*Find the area of the region bounded by the graphs of the given equations.*

$y=x^2−2x−2\\$
$y=x+2$

By solving above equations we get x=-1 and x=4
```{r}
eq1 <- function(x){(x^2)-(2*x)-2}

eq2 <- function(x){x+2}

integrate(eq1,-1,4)
integrate(eq2,-1,4)
```

Area=17.5-(-3.333333)=20.83333

## 5.

*A beauty supply store expects to sell 110 flat irons during the next year.  It costs $3.75 to store one flat iron for one year.  There is a fixed cost of $8.25 for each order.  Find the lot size and the number of orders per year that will minimize inventory costs.*

## 6.

*Use integration by parts to solve the integral below.*

$\int ln(9x) x^6dx$

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("C://13.6.jpeg")
```

## 7.

*Determine whether f (x) is a probability density function on the interval [1, $e^6$].  If not, determine the value of the definite integral.*

$f(x)=\frac{1}{6x}$
