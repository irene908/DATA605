# Chapter 9.2 , Exercise 7, Page 355

## A surveying instrument makes an error of −2, −1, 0, 1, or 2 feet with equal probabilities when measuring the height of a 200-foot tower.

### a) Find the expected value and the variance for the height obtained using this instrument once.

```{r}
h <- 200
error <- (-2+(-1)+0+1+2)/5

expected_val <- h + error
expected_val

variance <- ((-2)^2+(-1)^2+0^2+1^2+2^2)/5
variance
```

### b) Estimate the probability that in 18 independent measurements of this tower, the average of the measurements is between 199 and 201, inclusive.

$P(199<=Sn<=201)$

```{r}
standard_error <- sqrt(variance/18)

avg_lower <- (199-h) / standard_error
avg_upper <- (201-h) / standard_error

p <- pnorm(avg_upper) - pnorm(avg_lower)

print(round(p,3))
```
