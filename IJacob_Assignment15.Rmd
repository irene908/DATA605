## 1.

Find the equation of the regression line for the given points.  Round any final values to the nearest hundredth, if necessary.

( 5.6, 8.8 ), ( 6.3, 12.4 ), ( 7, 14.8 ), ( 7.7, 18.2 ), ( 8.4, 20.8 )

```{r}
df <- data.frame(x=c(5.6, 6.3, 7, 7.7, 8.4), y=c(8.8, 12.4, 14.8, 18.2, 20.8))

df.lm <- lm(y ~ x, df)
summary(df.lm)

plot(y ~ x, df)
abline(df.lm)
```

$y = -14.8 + 4.2571x$

## 2.

Find all local maxima, local minima, and saddle points for the function given below.  Write your answer(s) in the form (x, y, z).  Separate multiple points with a comma.

$$f(x,y) = 24x-6xy^2-8y^3$$

$$dfdx = 24 - 6y^2$$ 

$$dfdy = -12xy - 24y^2$$

$$ 24-6y^2 = 0$$ 

$$-12xy-24y^2 = 0$$ 

$$y = \sqrt{\frac{24}{6}} = \pm2$$ 

When y=2, x=-4

when y=-2, x=4

for (-4,2), $f(x,y) = -64$

for (4,-2), $f(x,y) = 64$

## 3.

A grocery store sells two brands of a product, the "house" brand and a "name" brand. The manager estimates that if she sells the "house" brand for x dollars and the "name" brand for y dollars, she will be able to sell $81-21x+17y$ units of the "house" brand and $40+11x-23y$ units of the "name" brand.

**Step 1. Find the revenue function R (x, y).**

$R(x,y) = x(81-21x+17y) + y(40+11x-23y)$

**Step 2. What is the revenue if she sells the "house" brand for $2.30 and the "name" brand for $4.10?**

R(x,y) = 2.3(81-21(2.3)+17(4.1))+4.1(40+11(2.3)-23(4.1))

R(x,y)  = $116.62

## 4.

A company has a plant in Los Angeles and a plant in Denver. The firm is committed to produce a total of 96 units of a  product each week. The total weekly cost is given by $C(x,y) = \frac{1}{6}x^2 + \frac{1}{6}y^2 +7x +25y +700$, where x is the number of  units produced in Los Angeles and y is the number of units produced in Denver. How many units should be produced in each plant to minimize the total weekly cost?
